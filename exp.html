           <h2>My Time at The University of Florida</h2>
           
           <p>When I came to The University of Florida, I was determined to get the most out of my college experience. I wasn't sure what I wanted to major in, but I knew that I wanted to learn how to write, and to write well.</p>
           
           <p>In my first semester at UF's College of Journalism and Communications, I found Rock104.com; an online rock radio station DJ'd completly by UF students. I began to get familiar with a radio production board and started recording short audio segments that would be played a few times a day in between songs.</p>
        <div class="audio">
            <p>Here is one of the 'Rock News' segments I would record for the website.</p>
           <audio src="rocknews.mp3" controls></audio>

           <p>Online radio was a great jumping off point in my journey into production, but I wanted to create something that would be seen by more people. My second year at UF, I discovered that not only did the college house radio stations, but also had an entire floor dedicated to television production. A team of UF students were in charge of writing and editing stories for Gainesville's local television station WUFT, and another team was in charge of airing those stories live every night at 5 o'clock sharp. </p>
                     
           <p>I began shadowing the broadcasts as a camera operator, and quickly worked my way up the ranks to become floor manager. Walking around with my headset on, I helped the show's anchors and the production room communicate during short commercial breaks. Live TV is exhilirating; it's like putting on a stage play, and you are left to work within the moment. But at the end of a year, I knew that there were things left to explore within the college, so I left the station and looked for other oppurtunities. </p>
           
      <p>As my journalism classes picked up, I through myself back into working on my writing. I began to get pieces published in UF's student newspaper, The Alligator, and even got an article published by The Gainesville Sun. In the midst of everything, I had gotten a job at the local ESPN AM radio station.</p>      
        
        <p>At the radio station I produced shows, communicated with the hosts and took callers. I described my job as "like Roz from the show, <em>'Frasier,'</em>" before I realized that that is a horribly outdated reference for my generation. Much like the television station, radio shows kept me in the moment, and I loved the dynamic between local callers and the host. Best of all, I was being paid for it; I finally felt like I had gained some status as a professional.</p>
           
        <p>While I kept my radio skills sharp and made some much-needed cash, I continued to pursue writing. I began working at The Florida Natural History Museum, the state's official natural history museum, as a public relations and marketing intern. In my position, I write press releases for the museum and local publications. While I have only been there a short time, I'm excited to see what oppurtunities it brings and to challenge myself as I expand my writing portfolio.</p>
           
        <p>Now as a dual-degree student coming into her senior year of college, I feel like my adventure has just begun. I'm traveling to Spain this summer to pursue an internship, and I can only imagine the possibilities. At the end of the day, I pride myself in being a journalism major who can not only write, but shoot, edit and produce audio and video. From details to the big picture, I'm ready to tackle it all as I move towards graduation.</p>
