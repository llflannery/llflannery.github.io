        <p>I love YouTube so much that I write a blog about vloggers and their communities.</p> <p>Check it out!</p>

        <p>My goal in my last few semesters at college has been to learn as much as I can about video editing and producing content for the web.</p>
        
         <p>Little by little, I have been gaining experience in editing video through Adobe Premiere and I have really enjoyed getting to learn new software. I shot, edited and uploaded these two videos for my classes and I am very excited to do more work like this in the future.</p>

            <p>I'm facinated by the internet and the communities it forms, and I would love to someday work for a company that works with creative individuals to create content for a variety of channels.</p>
